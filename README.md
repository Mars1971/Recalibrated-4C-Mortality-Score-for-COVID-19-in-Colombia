# Recalibrated 4C Mortality Score for COVID-19 in Colombia

### Introduction and Recommendation for the 4C Mortality Score Calculator in Predicting COVID-19 Mortality

Accurate risk stratification is vital for making hospitalization decisions in COVID-19 patients. This study assessed the 4C Mortality Score's ability to predict 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs). We conducted an external validation using a cohort of patients from seven high-complexity hospitals in Colombia, who presented between March 2020 and September 2021.

The 4C model showed the best discrimination (AUC 0.72, 95% CI 0.71–0.74) and clinical utility, though its calibration was imperfect. Decision curve analysis indicated its value in guiding hospitalization decisions at a ≥4% mortality risk threshold. After recalibration, the 4C model achieved an observed/expected ratio of 1 while preserving its predictive accuracy. 

The new formula for the recalibrated model is:

### New model = intercept_new (-1.049) + overall slope (0.781) * original 4C model logit
adjusting all logistic model coefficients. An online calculator based on this recalibrated model is presented below.

The 4C Mortality Score outperformed other models in predicting mortality. When used alongside clinical judgment, it can improve risk assessment, guide hospitalization decisions, and help optimize resource allocation. Recalibration and decision curve analysis enhance its practical application, but further validation with current data is necessary to confirm its broader applicability.
